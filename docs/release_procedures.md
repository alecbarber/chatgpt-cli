# Release Procedures Manual

## 1. Run the Ship-It Script

Execute the Ship-It script to prepare the release:

```shell
make shipit version=v1.2.3 message="in this release we changed xyz"
```

## 2. Create a GitHub release

Use the release notes generated by the `shipit` script when creating a new GitHub release. The `shipit` script also
creates the binaries required for the release in the `./bin` folder.

## 3. Bump the version

1. Update the URL and sha256 in the Homebrew formula (`kardolus/homebrew-chatgpt-cli/HomebrewFormula/chatgpt-cli.rb`).
2. Calculate the sha256 of the new tar file using:

```shell
sha256sum /path/to/tar/file
```
